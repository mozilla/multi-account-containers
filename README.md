# Containers: Test Pilot Experiment

[![Available on Test Pilot](https://img.shields.io/badge/available_on-Test_Pilot-0996F8.svg)](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers)

[Embedded Web Extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Embedded_WebExtensions) to experiment with [Containers](https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/06/16/contextual-identities-on-the-web/) in [Firefox Test Pilot](https://testpilot.firefox.com/) to learn:

* Will a general Firefox audience understand the Containers feature?
* Is the UI as currently implemented in Nightly clear or discoverable?

See [the Product Hypothesis Document for more
details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQdHTVXROk7dYkSFluc6_hS44tqZjIrG9I-uPyzevE8/edit?ts=5824ba12#).


## Requirements

* node 7+ (for jpm)
* Firefox 51+


## Run it

### Development Environment

Add-on development is better with [a particular  environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Setting_up_extension_development_environment). One simple way to get that environment set up is to install the [DevPrefs add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/devprefs/). You can make a custom Firefox profile that includes the DevPrefs add-on, and use that profile when you run the code in this repository. 


1. Make a new profile by running `/path/to/firefox -P`, which launches the profile editor. "Create Profile" -- name it whatever you wish (e.g. 'addon_dev') and store it in the default location. It's probably best to deselect the option to "Use without asking," since you probably don't want to use this as your default profile.

2. Once you've created your profile, click "Start Firefox". A new instance of Firefox should launch. Go to Tools->Add-ons and search for "DevPrefs". Install it. Quit Firefox.

3. Now you have a new, vanilla Firefox profile with the DevPrefs add-on installed. You can use your new profile with the code in _this_ repository like so:

**Beta building**

To build this for 51 beta just using the downloaded version of beta will not work as XPI signature checking is disabled fully.

The only way to run the experiment is using an [unbranded version build](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#Unbranded_Builds) or to build beta yourself:

1. [Download the mozilla-beta repo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Source_Code/Mercurial#mozilla-beta_(prerelease_development_tree))
2. [Create a mozconfig file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options) - probably optional
3. `cd <reponame>`
3. `./mach bootstrap`
4. `./mach build`
5. Follow the above instructions by creating the new profile via: `~/<reponame>/obj-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/dist/bin/firefox -P` (Where "obj-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu" may be different depending on platform obj-...)


### Run with jpm

1. `git clone git@github.com:mozilla/testpilot-containers.git`
2. `cd testpilot-containers`
3. `npm install`
4. `./node_modules/.bin/jpm run -p /Path/To/Firefox/Profiles/{junk}.addon_dev -b FirefoxBeta` (where FirefoxBeta might be: ~/<reponame>/obj-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/dist/bin/firefox or ~/<downloadedFirefoxBeta>/firefox)

Check out the [Browser Toolbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox) for more information about debugging add-on code.


### Building .xpi

To build a local .xpi, use the plain [`jpm
xpi`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#jpm_xpi) command.

### Signing an .xpi

To sign an .xpi, use [`jpm
sign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#jpm_sign)
command.

Note: You will need to be [an author on the AMO
add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/containers-experiment/ownership).
